🎧 Spotify Listening Analysis Dashboard | Power BI Project

This repository presents a comprehensive Business Intelligence project developed using Microsoft Power BI, focusing on analyzing user listening behavior on Spotify. The dashboard highlights trends in music consumption across albums, artists, and tracks, helping to uncover actionable insights for decision-making in streaming platforms and the digital entertainment space.

📌 Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop an interactive dashboard that enables stakeholders to:

- Understand how users engage with music content
- Identify top-performing albums, tracks, and artists
- Examine listening patterns across time (daily, monthly, yearly)
- Analyze weekday vs. weekend behavior
- Detect peak listening hours
- Compare Year-over-Year (YoY) growth
- Forecast future streaming trends

📊 Key Insights

- 📈 Analyzed 12,000+ tracks and multiple years of listening data
- 🗓️ 35% higher streaming observed on weekends compared to weekdays
- 🕒 Peak listening hours between 8 PM and 11 PM
- 🏆 Top 5 albums and artists contributed to over 45% of total streams
- 📉 18% increase in total plays in the latest year compared to the previous
- 🔮 Forecast analysis projects 15–18% growth in future listening behavior based on current trends
